# GrocerySells
Machine Learning Grocery Sells Prediction Project

1. Since our data was obtained from a Kaggle Challenge, we have browsed some of the submissions and used one of Notebooks as our reference for data loading and cleaning. The reference credit goes to @Kaggleslayer's Grocery prediction with Neural Network.

2 We learned how to apply nerual network using tensorflow from a youTube channel @sentdex. The credit goes to its video: "Deep Learning with Python, TensorFlow, and Keras tutorial".
